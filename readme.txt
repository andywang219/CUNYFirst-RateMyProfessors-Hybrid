==========How to get our project to work==========

1) Make sure your terminal is in the same directory as this readme.txt file.

2) Open mysql on your terminal and create a new database. You can name it anything you want, but we named it "theselectsquad"

3) Use the database you created and run "source TheSelectSquadDatabase.sql" which is a file located on this directory. This will give you all of our data. You can quit mysql once everything is successful.

4) Open "app.js" in your prefered text editor. On lines 13-18, edit the code to the information you use to login to your personal mysql database, including changing the database name if you decided to use a different database name for step (2). 

5) Make sure you have "Node.JS" installed. Execute in the terminal "node app.js"

6) If you connected the database correctly, the terminal should say "Connected" and not "error" If you see "error" you didn't properly edit lines 13-18 in "app.js" Go to the next step once you're successfully "Connected"

7) Go to your internet browser and type in the address bar: "127.0.0.1:8080" which is your computers local host on port 8080. If everything went okay, our website should load onto this page. 

8) Play around with the website! Mess around with the search feature, and click around on the results page. It's perfectly normal to have the front page refresh if you put an invalid input as it's programmed to do so (the terminal leaves a message for an incorrect input). To go back a page, you can use your browsers "Go Back One Page" button.

We plan on expanding this website for project 2 by giving it much more functionality. Our understanding of this first project was to correctly have a back end code to interact with our database and nicely display our results.

If you have any questions, feel free to email any of the members of The Select Squad.
