==========How to get our project to work==========

1) Make sure your terminal is in the same directory as this readme.txt file.

2) Open mysql on your terminal and run 'source db.sql', 'source procedure.sql', source trigger.sql;'

3) Open "app.js" in your preferred text editor. On lines 13-18, edit the code to the information you use to login to your personal mysql database. You probably only need to change the password as everything else should be correct.

4) Make sure you have "Node.JS" installed. Execute in the terminal "node app.js"

5) If you connected the database correctly, the terminal should say "Connected" and not "Error connecting to database" If you see "Error connecting to database" you didn't properly edit lines 13-18 in "app.js" Go to the next step once you're successfully "Connected"

6) Go to your internet browser and type in the address bar: "127.0.0.1:8080" or "localhost:8080" which is your computers local host on port 8080. If everything went okay, our website should load onto this page.

7) Play around with the website! Mess around with the search feature, and click around on the results page. It's perfectly normal to have the front page refresh if you put an invalid input as it's programmed to do so (the terminal leaves a message for an incorrect input). To go back a page, you can use your browsers "Go Back One Page" button.

If you have any questions, feel free to email any of the members of The Select Squad.
